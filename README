These are implementations of the algorithms in the book "A=B", as well as
(maybe) some generalizations.  These are algorithms for evaluating
hypergeometric sums in closed form.

The book is available online here:

This is essentially a personal project, to learn how these algorithms work.
Hopefully they will eventually be useful to the broader mathematical
community as a whole, but please do bear in mind that I am not yet an expert
in this area.  Nothing is currently certified to be bug-free.
